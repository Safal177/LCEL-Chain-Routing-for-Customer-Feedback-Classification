    "•\tDivide user messages into certain categories using an LLM.\n",
    "•\tSend each message to the matching branch using LCEL’s route.\n",
    "•\tDevelop customer findings: highlights, sentiment, interpret, and summarize.\n",
    "•\tMake a clean system for Agentic AI Workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Essentials:\n",
    "•\tClassification on customers feedback from LLM.\n",
    "•\tBranching from LCEL RunnableBranch task.\n",
    "•\tUsing prompt engineering to get intended chain.\n",
    "•\tGenerate end to end chain.\n",
    "•\tTesting different cases for customer feedback.\n",
    "•\tunsupported categories solved with a default function (no_match).\n",
