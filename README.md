# LCEL-Chain-Routing-for-Customer-Feedback-Classification


# Project Title
End-to-End Customer Comments Analysis Workflow Using LCEL Chain Routing with  LangChain and OpenAI

# Project Objective:
Key objectives are:
•	Divide user messages into certain categories using an LLM.
•	Send each message to the matching branch using LCEL’s route.
•	Develop customer findings: highlights, sentiment, interpret, and summarize.
•	Make a clean system for Agentic AI Workflows.

# Essentials:
•	Classification on customers feedback from LLM.
•	Branching from LCEL RunnableBranch task.
•	Using prompt engineering to get intended chain.
•	Generate end to end chain.
•	Testing different cases for customer feedback.
•	unsupported categories solved with a default function (no_match).
